######## TIC TAC TOE ################
#### MY FIRST JAVASCRIPT PROJECT ####
Why on gods green earth did I name my project tic tac toe... sigh I'm dumb.
Anywho... I tried following ToP and wrote some function finding the switch case quite useful to compare a string to mulitple choices.
Once that was done the rest was easy.
The random number between an upper and lower floor, included, is common and an elegant solution was found online.
